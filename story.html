            <h2>The Evolution of Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                Programming languages have transformed the way humans interact with machines, enabling the creation of 
                groundbreaking technology that powers the modern world. From the simplicity of assembly languages to 
                the complexity of high-level programming, each step in the evolution of programming languages has 
                unlocked new possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                It all began in the 1940s with the development of machine code, a set of binary instructions executed 
                directly by computers. Soon after, assembly languages made coding more accessible by introducing 
                human-readable mnemonics. The advent of FORTRAN in the 1950s marked the first high-level language, 
                revolutionizing scientific computing.

            <p>
                In the 1990s and beyond, the rise of object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++ changed 
                the software landscape. Meanwhile, web technologies gave birth to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, forming 
                the backbone of the internet. Today, languages like Python and R are leading the way in data science 
                and AI, while Swift and Kotlin dominate mobile development.
            </p>

            <p>
                The story of programming languages is far from over. With new innovations such as quantum computing 
                on the horizon, the next chapter is waiting to be written by passionate developers like you!
